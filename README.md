## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap Navigation, Grid, Offcanvas, and Flexbox
- Javascript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)


### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice implementing Bootstrap navigation and the offcanvas component to create a sidebar navigation in mobile view. When Bootstrap's offcanvas component did not work as expected in my project, I found a helpful article and implementation with some custom JS and CSS along with the Bootstrap framework that helped me through this stage. Ultimately, I realized that whether using only Bootstrap or with the custom JS, I had to move the toggle button (hamburger icon) outside of the navigation menu in order for offcanvas to work. If I had realized that sooner, I believe I could have completed the sidebar menu without using the additional JS.


### Continued development

I'd like to try using only the Bootstrap elements to complete the sidebar menu to fully understand its functionality for future projects. I'd also like to look into how to use Bootstrap in conjunction with semantic HTML to clearly define meaning and make the site more accessible.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/) - Always reference the documentation.
- [Bootstrap navbar offcanvas on mobile](https://bootstrap-menu.com/detail-offcanvas-mobile.html) - This is the article and demo site that helped me figure out the offcanvas sidebar menu for mobile.
